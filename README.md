you can find the direct executable file under the releases section of github

"you can make changes and add feature accordingly or if you are not a developer , then you can contect me , hopefully i can help you"

this machine works on he principle of absolute randomness as nothing is random even when you use random function in language , thier is always some preset of algorithms running which defines the final output but this software generates a random numbers based on current time which can never be same so you will enjoy absolute randomness

the strings generated are absolute random , you can use them as your passwords even

you can decide the length of the input string and even decide the lower and upperlimit of the random number generated 

sat starting you will be asked to choice btw 
        randum string                - 1
				randum number                - 2
				randum floating point number - 3
        
you can change the choices and parameters filled previously by entering 1 at the end or you can enter 0 for repeating the process with the process with the current parameter or enter -1 to exit the program
